# About

Tiles is an inventor toolkit 💡 for creative people, students and non-experts to play, learn and ideate human-centric Internet of Things inventions, while having fun.

See the official website https://www.tilestoolkit.io and github repository [tilestoolkit/tiles-IoT-inventor-toolkit](https://github.com/tilestoolkit/tiles-IoT-inventor-toolkit) for additional details.

This repository includes all the text contained in the Tiles Cards and the Tiles Inventor Board, translated in several languages.

# Translation

The repository will be gradually updated to include the translations performed by contributors 🤓.

A predefined list of target languages is already in place, but it's possible to add more if needed ✍️.


# Contribute

If you want to help translating the toolkit into a specific language, get in touch via the official website 🎉. The translations are performed in [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), a cloud based solution for collaborative translations.

We can invite you to join our Crowdin project as a translator for a specific language, you won't need to install anything nor interact directly with this repository, everything happens in Crowdin 🥳.
